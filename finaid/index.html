    <p>The main reason for me to apply for financial aid is the monthly cost of the specialization.
I am working part time while trying to support myself as a developer and student, while also paying my student loans.
My salary as a part time worker is not enough, and to get ahead in my career I need to keep learning.
The cost of the monthly subscription is too high for me to be able to afford.
However the content being offered in this specialization is extremely useful.
It provides very specific information that is required to move forward as a product designer and forsee the pitfalls associated with bad design decisions that may make technologically sound applications and processes much harder than what they need to be.
In addition I come from a third world country where the monthly cost of the course subscription is very high compared to the average cost of living which with my given employment state makes it even harder for me.

The content being offered in this specialization is extremely useful.
In addition to design being a very lucrative job, there is the added incentive of making certain jobs easier for other people and adding a sense of convenience to tasks that might seem like too much work, thereby discouraging users from registering or applying for legal or governmental forms and processes.
I have often dealt with interfaces that were very intutive for users and I wish to understand how the designers forsaw how the users would respond to a particular state and then reacted accordingly. In the same vein, I have dealt with frustrating interfaces that could be improved, but I don't understand where to start and how to improve them. I hope that this specialization will help me understand how to solve these problems.
